# Foreign Currency Exchange Prediction Project

## Overview

This project aims to predict foreign currency exchange rates using machine learning techniques. The data was obtained from the Free Currency API (https://freecurrencyapi.com/) and processed to clean outliers, missing and null values. A Random Forest Regression model was trained on the preprocessed data, and hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize the model's performance. The model's predictions were evaluated using accuracy metrics, and privacy was ensured using the Privacy-Aware Training Environments (PATE) framework for security.
